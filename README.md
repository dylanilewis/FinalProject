What did the model prove?

Answer goes here. (This is the paragraph where we should talk about the strategies and the results of them: e.g. players with pocket pairs preflop that never fold in later stages lost 6/10 instances or players with a handscore of 0 postFlop won 9/10 instances).

What tradeoffs did you make in choosing your representation? What else did you try that didnâ€™t work as well?

We made many different tradeoffs in our representation, usually after trying to implement a feature that was not working or realistic. One tradeoff we had to make was setting our representation to always be the initial round of a game of poker, where all players have the same amount of chips. We came with the initial idea that our model should be able to model any round of poker and all player's chips should be a random number, but upon trying to implement this idea it added a ton of complexity to betting, and caused too many bugs and setbacks for us to justify its implementation. Another tradeoff we made was completely scrapping the idea of using temporal forge to model our project. We spent the first one to two weeks attempting to utiliize temporal forge, but upon running into many bugs regarding transitioning between states, we switched to relational. Other things that we tried but were eventually unable to include in our model (usually due to bugs), were more robust player betting (allowing for re-raising, all-in'ing and split pots), including and tracking player's and the table's stacks of chips and implementing ante's and specific poker positions on a table.

What assumptions did you make about scope? What are the limits of your model?

Assumption answer goes here.

There are quite a few limits of our model that we acknowledge or even chose to include. One of our limits is that unfortunately in our model there is no difference between a pair of Kings and a pair of Two's. This is a very large part of real life poker, but given the time constraints we de-prioritized this functionality and were not able to eventually implement it. Another limit of our model, which we previously mentioned is that the betting mechanics are not fully realized. While betting works, in real life poker this is a big difference between raising and re-raising, but in our model those are essentially the same thing, as a value of the round bet is set and player's must either match it or fold.

Did your goals change at all from your proposal? Did you realize anything you planned was unrealistic, or that anything you thought was unrealistic was doable?

Our goals did change quite a bit from our proposal. Initially, our reach goal was to perfectly model a whole game of poker with everysingle rule and nuance that a game of Texas hold'em entails. However, upon beginning our work and especially after switching from temporal to relational forge, we realized this goal was massively unrealistic. We switched our goal to a more realistic target of modelling a single round of poker. Then inside of this singular round of poker we quickly realised that the ideal scenario of modelling niche rules (such as split pots or straddles) were unrealistic and we should focus our time and effort in implementing the core functionalities of Texas hold'em.

How should we understand an instance of your model and what your visualization shows (whether custom or default)?

In the default vizualizer, our model is extremely difficult to understand if you look at the graph tab. We highly recommend analyzing our model through the table tab, as this becomes much easier to read and understand (while still confusing at first). The main sigs to keep in mind are the fields of a RoundState. The players tell you which players remain in the round at which stages. You should notice that all 4 players are in the game at the beginning of the round (preFlop), but many of them have left the game (folded) at same point in the round, with often only having 1 or 2 players remaining in the game at (postFlop). Another thing to track is the score and hand tables as these tables tell you which hand belongs to which player and then also how strong each player's hand is (positive numbers correlate to strong hands, while negative numbers are weaker hands). Another important field to track is the winner field as this field indicates which player wins the game and in which roundstate they won. Another important field is the bet field. this fields value tells you what happened in regards to player's betting for that round. If the bet is 0, then all players checked, else if bet is not zero then a player raised, and all those that are remaining in the next state matched that bet. Finally the board and deck fields are important because these fields tell you which cards are shared by all players (the cards on the board) and the potential cards that could eventually be put on the board (cards in the deck).

Screenshots of instances goes here: APPARENTLY THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT TO TIM FOR BOTH README AND FINAL PRESENTATION (at least 1 with only 1 player remaining postRiver (that player being the winner), at least 1 with multiple players remaining postRiver (and one with strongest hand being the winner), 1-2 screenshots of instances of the strategies mentioned above, 1-2 screenshots of interesting instances (something like royal flush is drawn or all players fold on postFlop so 1 player instantly wins)). We can and should rig these using specific run statements, but still need to show them.

Screenshot of all tests passing: ALSO VERY IMPORTANT TO TIM ESPECIALLY BECAUSE TEST FILE TAKES FOREVER TO RUN (TIM USUALLY HAS PEOPLE RUN THE TEST FILE IN THE FINAL DEMO IN FRONT OF HIM)
